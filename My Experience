My Experience with Creating and Playing "Color Match Memory"

Creating Color Match Memory was an exciting and educational experience for me. It was my first hands-on project using Unity Hub, and through this game, I learned how to build a complete and interactive game from scratch.

From designing colorful buttons and adding sound effects to managing scores and game over screens, each step was a new challenge. One of the most satisfying parts was seeing the game respond correctly when a player repeated the color pattern—it felt like I was really bringing my ideas to life.

I also learned how to:

Use Canvas and UI elements like panels, buttons, and text

Implement background music and sound effects

Set up game logic using C# scripts

Display score and high score on the game over screen

Handle UI resizing, button actions, and scene design

Although I faced some bugs—like the restart button and high score text not updating properly—I learned how to troubleshoot and fix issues by checking the Unity Inspector, scripting errors, and object references.

Playing the game is really fun and surprisingly addictive! Every time the pattern gets longer, it pushes me to focus and test my memory. It’s a game I can see others enjoying casually in their free time.

Overall, this project helped me understand Unity better, improved my logic-building skills, and boosted my confidence in game development.
